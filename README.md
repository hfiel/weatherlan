 **ARCHIVED REPO** WeatherLAN: Sensor de temperatura y humedad con Arduino

This is an archived copy with all the code and documentation from my 2011 project *"WeatherLAN: temperature and humidity sensor with Arduino"*.
The documentation is in Spanish, and not a single line has been changed since the original publishing.

**This is absolutely outdated, I do not recommend using it at all.**

I am keeping it here only for historical storage.

My code is bad, probably the used libraries won't work anymore on any Arduino development environment, and there are probably hundreds of better and more modern solutions out there.

I will not provide any guarantee (or help) at all: **USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.**
